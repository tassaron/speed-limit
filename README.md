# Speed Limit 🛑
A game for html5 canvas using vanilla javascript. Works with a touchscreen too!

playable at [my website](https://fun.tassaron.com/speed-limit)

## How to play
Pass cars ahead of you in your lane to collect their coins. Copper, silver, and gold coins are worth $500, $1000, and $1500 respectively. Coins will also spawn randomly on the opposite lane of the road, along with jerrycans you can collect to refuel your vehicle. Watch that fuel meter!! And don't crash into too many traffic cones either. There's a lot of crazy drivers out there... but at least you're following the speed limit! 🤷‍♀️
